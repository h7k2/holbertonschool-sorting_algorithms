# C - Sorting Algorithms & Big O

## ðŸ“š Description

This project is part of the Holberton School curriculum and focuses on implementing sorting algorithms in C, as well as analyzing their performance using Big O notation.

We implemented several classic algorithms and learned how to evaluate their efficiency, stability, and behavior on different data structures such as arrays and linked lists.

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, I am able to:

- Explain at least four different sorting algorithms
- Understand Big O notation and analyze time complexity
- Choose the most efficient sorting algorithm for a specific case
- Understand what makes a sorting algorithm stable or unstable
